# Plots Directory

The `plots` directory houses all visualization files related to data analysis and model evaluation. This helps keep visual outputs organized, facilitating easy review and reference during the research and development process.

#### Subdirectories:
- **`archived/`**: Stores old or outdated plots that may no longer be actively used but are kept for historical reference.
- **`data_visualization/`**: Plots that provide insights into the raw and processed data, helping understand patterns, distributions, and potential issues in the dataset.
- **`figure_generation/`**: Scripts and templates used to generate figures, especially those intended for inclusion in papers or presentations.
- **`gifs/`**: Animated visualizations that show model outputs or data transformations over time. Useful for dynamic demonstrations of model behavior.
- **`model_evaluation/`**: Plots that display model performance, such as accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrices, etc., aiding in evaluating model effectiveness.
