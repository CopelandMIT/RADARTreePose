### `models/` README

# Models Directory

The `models` directory is the repository for all model-related code, data, and experiment logs. This structure allows you to develop, store, and evaluate different machine learning and data processing models in an organized manner.

#### Subdirectories:
- **`model_code/`**: Contains scripts and Jupyter notebooks for developing and training models. This includes the architecture definitions, training routines, and utility functions needed for model experimentation.
- **`model_data/`**: Datasets specific to model training and evaluation. This can include training, validation, and test sets, along with any transformed data used exclusively for modeling purposes.
- **`model_experiments/`**: Logs, checkpoints, and records of experiments conducted with various models. Organizes experiment outcomes to make it easy to track model performance and replicate results.
