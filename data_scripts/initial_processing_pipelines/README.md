# Initial Processing Pipelines

This folder contains the initial data processing pipelines designed to preprocess and transform raw radar data into a format suitable for downstream analysis and model training. The pipelines here are organized by their development status: archived, finalized, and in-progress. This setup ensures that only the most stable and well-tested pipelines are used in production, while experimental ones can be refined.

## Folder Structure

- `initial_processing_pipelines/`
  - `archived_processing_pipelines/`: Contains older versions of processing pipelines that are no longer in use but are kept for reference and historical purposes.
  - `finalized_processing_pipelines/`: Stores fully developed and tested pipelines that are ready for consistent use in data processing.
  - `in_progress_processing_pipelines/`: Houses processing pipelines that are currently under development and testing.
    - `RADAR_RDM_Generation_v1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that generates Radar Data Matrices (RDMs) from raw radar data, with various parameters for experimental setup.
  - `README.md`: Documentation file for explaining the structure and usage of the pipelines.

## Pipeline Descriptions

### 1. Archived Processing Pipelines
- **Purpose**: This directory stores previous iterations of processing pipelines. These pipelines may no longer align with current project requirements but are retained to provide insights into the evolution of data processing approaches.
- **Note**: Avoid using these pipelines unless referencing previous methods or debugging historical data.

### 2. Finalized Processing Pipelines
- **Purpose**: Contains stable and verified processing pipelines that are used for production-level data preparation. These pipelines are considered robust and are trusted for generating consistent, high-quality processed data.
- **Usage**: Use the scripts in this directory for official data processing tasks. Ensure these pipelines are up-to-date with any latest project requirements.

### 3. In-Progress Processing Pipelines
- **Purpose**: This directory holds experimental pipelines that are still undergoing development and testing. They are useful for exploring new methods or adjusting parameters before finalizing.
- **Example**: 
  - **RADAR_RDM_Generation_v1.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook processes raw radar data to produce Radar Data Matrices (RDMs). It allows parameter tweaking and visualization for understanding the data transformation process.
- **Note**: Use caution when using in-progress pipelines for important data, as these are subject to change and may not be fully tested.

## Output Directory

Processed data generated by these pipelines is saved in the following directory structure within the `RADARTreePose_Data` folder:

- **`RADARTreePose_Data/processed/`**: Contains all processed data outputs organized by data type.
  - **`force_plate/`**: Processed data related to force plate measurements.
  - **`mocap/`**: Processed data related to motion capture.
  - **`radar/`**:
    - **`feature_engineered/`**: Radar data with additional features engineered for analysis.
    - **`RDMs_npy_by_channel_v1/`**: Radar Data Matrices saved in `.npy` format, organized by channel.
    - **`RDMs_npy_v1/`**: Radar Data Matrices in `.npy` format, organized by version.

Ensure that all processed data outputs are saved in the appropriate sub-directory within `RADARTreePose_Data/processed` for consistency and easy access.

## Usage

Each pipeline script is designed to be used independently, depending on the stage of data processing. Follow these steps to use a processing pipeline:

1. **Choose a Pipeline**:
   - If you are processing data for model training or official analysis, use a pipeline from `finalized_processing_pipelines`.
   - If experimenting with data transformations or developing new preprocessing techniques, use a pipeline from `in_progress_processing_pipelines`.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - For Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `RADAR_RDM_Generation_v1.ipynb`), open the notebook in Jupyter or another compatible environment to run the code and visualize the outputs.
   - For Python scripts, execute them from the command line or integrate them into your existing data processing workflows.

3. **Output**:
   - Processed data will be saved under `RADARTreePose_Data/processed`, ensuring a structured and organized storage format. Each type of data will be in its respective sub-directory.

## Notes

- **Data Consistency**: Always ensure that the raw data format matches the expected input format for each pipeline.
- **Documentation**: Each finalized pipeline should include comments and inline documentation to clarify the processing steps.
- **Versioning**: When finalizing a new pipeline, consider archiving the older version if it differs significantly in functionality.
